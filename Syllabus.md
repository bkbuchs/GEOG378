# Geog 378: Introduction to Geocomputing

Instructor: Prof. Song Gao

Teaching Assistant: Yuying Chen

[Email:](chen449@wisc.edu)

## Overview
Geography 378 (GEOG378) will introduce students to the scripting and programming tools and
skills commonly employed in GIS and spatial analysis using Python. The skills learned in this
course are equally applicable in scientific research, the public sector, and private industry. This
course helps satisfy the programming requirements of the Cartography/GIS
undergraduate/graduate major and provides foundational knowledge for the Online Professional
Masterâ€™s in GIS & Web Map Programming as well as for the GIS certificate program students. No
programming background is assumed for this course.
Course Learning Objectives
Upon completion of the course modules, the student is expected to:
  - Be able to write shell commands to accomplish common (batch)geoprocessing tasks
  using popular open-source utility programs, and they will learn when these utilities are
  preferred over mainstream GIS software.
  - Have basic skills in the Python programming language, and they will have acquired
  programming concepts necessary for advanced GIS courses that require programming.
  - Know how to use Python with open-source GIS libraries regardless of the Integrated
  Development Environment (IDE). The students will also learn how Python can extend
  the capabilities of ArcGIS to solve problems difficult or impossible to address otherwise.
  - Be familiar with major geospatial vector and raster file formats and specifications for
spatial reference coordinate systems.
  - Have used and be comfortable with online resources that support geocomputing and
  programming in the GIS profession.
  - Learn newly developed GIS computation tools/libraries and platforms.

## Course Materials

**Textbook:**
  * Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist by Allen Downey et al., 2014,
  O'Reilly.

**Recommended Readings:**
  * Python Scripting for ArcGIS, by P.A. Zandbergen. ESRI Press, 2014, 358 pp.
  * Introduction to GIS Programming and Fundamentals with Python and ArcGIS By Chaowei
  Yang et al., 2017, CRC Press.

*All lecture slides and notes are available on the Canvas.*

## Grading

**70% Lab Assignments + 30% Quizzes**

Course grades will be based on 2 in-class quizzes (30% of total grade) and 8 laboratory
assignments (70% of total grade). Quizzes will be given in the class and will cover the material
presented in the course lectures and notes with an emphasis on concepts and vocabulary. Lab
assignments will require original programming based on lecture material. Lab assignments are
not scheduled weekly, but there will be weekly lab time scheduled (consult your lab section for
times) and you can use this time to work on your assignments or work through course material.
There is no final exam or other summary activity for this course.

**Grading Scale:**

 Score | Grade | Grade Points Per Credit
 |:---:|:---:|:---:|
90 or >|  A | (Excellent) 4|
86 ~ 89.99 | AB | (Intermediate grade) 3.5|
80 ~ 85.99 | B | (Good) 3|
76 ~ 79.99 | BC | (Intermediate grade) 2.5|
70 ~ 75.99 | C | (Fair) 2|
60 ~ 69.99 | D | (Poor) 1|
< 60 |F | (Failure) 0|

## Communication & Accommodation

The University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal
educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute
(36.12), and UW-Madison policy (Faculty Document 1071) require that students with disabilities
be reasonably accommodated in instruction and campus life. Reasonable accommodations for
students with disabilities is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Students are expected to
inform faculty of their need for instructional accommodations by the end of the third week of
the semester, or as soon as possible after a disability has been incurred or recognized. Faculty
will work either directly with the student or in coordination with the McBurney Center to identify
and provide reasonable instructional accommodations. Disability information, including
instructional accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and
protected under FERPA. If you face any personal or professional difficulties or require
accommodation or a disability, please feel free to contact me as soon as possible.

## Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is critical to the mission of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a research
institution with high academic standards and rigor. All members of the University community
play a role in fostering an environment in which student learning is achieved in a fair, just, and
honest way. Plagiarism is prohibited in lab assignments and quizzes. Any offense results in a zero for the grade and disclosure of the impropriety to the Department and University.
